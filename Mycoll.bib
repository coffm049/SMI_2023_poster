abstract = {The genetic architecture of brain structure and function is largely unknown. To investigate this, we carried out genome-wide association studies of 3,144 functional and structural brain imaging phenotypes from UK Biobank (discovery dataset 8,428 subjects). Here we show that many of these phenotypes are heritable. We identify 148 clusters of associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and imaging phenotypes that replicate at P {\textless} 0.05, when we would expect 21 to replicate by chance. Notable significant, interpretable associations include: iron transport and storage genes, related to magnetic susceptibility of subcortical brain tissue; extracellular matrix and epidermal growth factor genes, associated with white matter micro-structure and lesions; genes that regulate mid-line axon development, associated with organization of the pontine crossing tract; and overall 17 genes involved in development, pathway signalling and plasticity. Our results provide insights into the genetic architecture of the brain that are relevant to neurological and psychiatric disorders, brain development and ageing. Genome-wide association studies of brain imaging data from 8,428 individuals in UK Biobank show that many of the 3,144 traits studied are heritable, and genes associated with individual phenotypes are identified.},

@article{Yang2011,
abstract = {For most human complex diseases and traits, SNPs identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) explain only a small fraction of the heritability. Here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the "missing heritability" problem. GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large GWAS data sets. {\textcopyright} 2011 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

@article{Lin2020,
abstract = {SNP heritability of a trait is measured by the proportion of total variance explained by the additive effects of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Linear mixed models are routinely used to estimate SNP heritability for many complex traits. The basic concept behind this approach is to model genetic contribution as a random effect, where the variance of this genetic contribution attributes to the heritability of the trait. This linear mixed model approach requires estimation of ‘relatedness' among individuals in the sample, which is usually captured by estimating a genetic relationship matrix (GRM). Heritability is estimated by the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) or method of moments (MOM) approaches, and this estimation relies heavily on the GRM computed from the genetic data on individuals. Presence of population substructure in the data could significantly impact the GRM estimation and may introduce bias in heritability estimation. The common practice of accounting for such population substructure is to adjust for the top few principal components of the GRM as covariates in the linear mixed model. Here we propose an alternative way of estimating heritability in multi-ethnic studies. Our proposed approach is a MOM estimator derived from the Haseman-Elston regression and gives an asymptotically unbiased estimate of heritability in presence of population stratification. It introduces adjustments for the population stratification in a second-order estimating equation and allows for the total phenotypic variance vary by ethnicity. We study the performance of different MOM and REML approaches in presence of population stratification through extensive simulation studies. We estimate the heritability of height, weight and other anthropometric traits in the UK Biobank cohort to investigate the impact of subtle population substructure on SNP heritability estimation.
